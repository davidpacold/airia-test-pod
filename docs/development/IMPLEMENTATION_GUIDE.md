## Testing Framework Architecture

### Base Test Infrastructure
- **Base Test Class**: Common functionality for all tests
- **Connection Mixin**: Shared connection handling patterns
- **Test Runner**: Orchestrates test execution and reporting
- **Result Models**: Standardized test result structures

### Test Execution Flow
1. **Configuration Validation**: Verify required settings are present
2. **Connection Testing**: Establish and validate connections
3. **Functional Testing**: Execute service-specific operations
4. **Performance Metrics**: Collect timing and performance data
5. **Error Analysis**: Provide specific remediation suggestions
6. **Cleanup**: Ensure proper resource cleanup

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tests continue even if individual tests fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error messages with context
- **Remediation Suggestions**: Specific guidance for fixing issues
- **Security Considerations**: Sanitized error messages to prevent information leakage

---

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
All tests are configurable via environment variables with sensible defaults:

```yaml
# Authentication
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=changeme
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

# PostgreSQL
POSTGRESQL_ENABLED=false
POSTGRESQL_HOST=localhost
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=postgres
# ... additional service configurations
```

### Kubernetes Integration
- **ConfigMaps**: Non-sensitive configuration
- **Secrets**: Sensitive credentials and API keys
- **Environment Variable Injection**: Helm template-driven configuration

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Async Operations**: All I/O operations use async/await patterns
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Concurrent Testing**: Multiple tests can run simultaneously
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks

### Monitoring & Metrics
- **Health Endpoints**: Kubernetes-native health checking
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution timing and success rates
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU utilization tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Categorized error reporting

---

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management
- **Configurable Credentials**: Environment-based authentication
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout for security

### Input Validation
- **Request Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation and size limits
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only

### Container Security
- **Non-root User**: Application runs as unprivileged user
- **Minimal Base Image**: Reduced attack surface
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **Secret Management**: Kubernetes-native secret handling

---

## Deployment Patterns

### Development Environment
```bash
# Local development with port forwarding
kubectl port-forward svc/airia-test-pod 8080:80
```

### Production Environment
```yaml
# Helm values for production
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "nginx"
  hosts:
    - host: test-pod.yourdomain.com
  tls:
    - secretName: airia-test-pod-tls
```

### Multi-Environment Support
- **Development**: Basic deployment with port forwarding
- **Staging**: Ingress with SSL termination
- **Production**: Full ingress with multiple hostnames and SSL
