# Documentation Directory

*Organized documentation for the Airia Infrastructure Test Pod*

## Directory Structure

### `/development/` - Development Resources
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Consolidated development roadmap and architecture
- **`CI_CD_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`** - CI/CD enhancement proposals and future improvements
- **`IMPROVEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`** - Code quality and feature enhancement suggestions

### `/operations/` - Operational Procedures
- **`VERSIONING.md`** - Version management guidelines and procedures
- **`ROLLBACK.md`** - Rollback procedures and emergency response strategies

### `/archive/` - Historical Reference
- **`PRD.md`** - Original Product Requirements Document

## Primary Documentation (Root Level)

The main user-facing documentation is located in the repository root:
- **`README.md`** - Project overview, features, and quick start guide
- **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Complete deployment instructions and configuration

## Documentation Consolidation

This documentation structure has been optimized to eliminate duplication and provide clear information hierarchy:

- **Removed duplicate content** across multiple files
- **Consolidated implementation planning** into single comprehensive guide
- **Streamlined operational procedures** for easier maintenance
- **Archived historical documents** while preserving important reference material

### What Was Consolidated

- ✅ **Implementation Planning**: Merged `IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md` and `ITERATIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` into `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ **Project Overview**: Removed duplicate project summaries, centralized in root `README.md`
- ✅ **Version Management**: Consolidated detailed analysis into practical `VERSIONING.md` guide
- ✅ **Historical Content**: Archived outdated test fixes and moved project summaries

This structure reduces maintenance overhead while ensuring all critical information remains accessible.
